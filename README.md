# Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical daily closing data of multiple stocks. The dataset provides a structured view of stock price movements over time, allowing for analysis using time series forecasting techniques such as ARIMA. This is a foundational exercise in financial data analytics and forecasting.
## üìÇ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains:

- **Rows**: Daily records of trading days
- **Columns**:
  - `Date`: Trading date (used as the index)
  - `Stock_1`, `Stock_2`, ..., `Stock_n`: Daily closing prices of various stocks

Each stock's price is influenced by real-world market factors such as supply and demand, company performance, and macroeconomic indicators.

## üîç Project Goals

- Load and explore historical stock data
- Analyze trends, seasonality, and stationarity
- Decompose time series components (trend, seasonality, residual)
- Apply ARIMA modeling using `pmdarima`'s `auto_arima`
- Forecast future prices for selected stocks
- Visualize historical data and future forecasts
